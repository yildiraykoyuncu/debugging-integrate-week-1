# Debugging: integrate, week 1

This set of exercises has 4 challenges in the `/scripts` folder.  Your first task is to fill in the blanks in `index.html`, then you'll be able to work your way through the .js files.

Have fun!

## How to DevTool

- Always have your DevTools open.  The debugger will be overwhelming at first, but very quickly you won't know how to work without it.
- Set your debugger to [__pause on exceptions__](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2015/05/automatically-pause-on-any-exception)
- Carefully read all console output, especially error messages. Errors aren't failure they are JavaScript trying to help you!
- Expand errors to practice reading the callstack
- Click on the line numbers to the right of console output to read the source code

## Good Habits

- Test your code __all the time__.  Every time you make any changes, click the button to see what changed
- Make one change at a time. If you make many changes at once it's hard to know which one made a difference.

## The Exercises

There two types of exercises:

### Fill in the Blanks

The first two exercises have several blanks (`_`) you need to fill in.  Besides the blanks these exercises don't have any bugs or mistakes. A little hint:

- Start at the top and work your way down, one blank at a time

### Fix the Bugs

The second two exercises have errors and bugs you need to fix. Look out for every little detail! A little hint:

- Follow the callstacks.  Click the button, find the line of code that caused the error, try to fix it, repeat.  One error at a time.
